# Backend Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the Smart Shopping Hub backend API to Render automatically.

## Prerequisites

1. A Render account (https://render.com)
2. Your GitHub repository (https://github.com/Mohansaina/smart-shopping-hub) should be up to date

## Automatic Deployment to Render

### Step 1: Connect Render to Your GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "New" â†’ "Web Service"
4. Select "GitHub" as the source
5. Connect your GitHub account if prompted
6. Find and select "Mohansaina/smart-shopping-hub" repository

### Step 2: Configure Your Web Service

Render will automatically detect the configuration from your `render.yaml` file:

- **Name**: `smart-shopping-hub-api`
- **Root Directory**: `server`
- **Runtime**: Node
- **Build Command**: `cd server && npm install`
- **Start Command**: `cd server && npm start`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `NODE_ENV`: `production`
  - `PORT`: `10000`

### Step 3: Deploy

1. Click "Create Web Service"
2. Render will automatically:
   - Clone your repository
   - Install dependencies
   - Build your application
   - Start your server

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

1. Watch the build logs in the Render dashboard
2. The deployment typically takes 2-5 minutes
3. Once deployed, you'll see a URL like: `https://smart-shopping-hub-api.onrender.com`

## Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. Install the Render CLI: `npm install -g render-cli`
2. Log in: `render login`
3. Deploy: `render deploy --yaml=render.yaml`

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are automatically set:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
```

You can add additional environment variables in the Render dashboard:
1. Go to your service in the Render dashboard
2. Click "Environment" in the sidebar
3. Add any additional variables you need

## Health Check

Your API includes a health check endpoint:
- `GET /api/health` - Returns status information

You can monitor this endpoint to ensure your service is running properly.

## Updating Your Deployment

To update your backend after making changes:

1. Commit and push your changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update backend"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. Render will automatically redeploy your service

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build failures**:
   - Check the build logs in the Render dashboard
   - Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
   - Verify the build and start commands are correct

2. **Application crashes**:
   - Check the application logs in the Render dashboard
   - Ensure environment variables are properly set
   - Verify the PORT variable matches what your app expects

3. **Slow responses**:
   - Free tier services on Render may have cold starts
   - Consider upgrading to a paid plan for production use

### Logs

You can view detailed logs in the Render dashboard:
1. Go to your service
2. Click "Logs" in the sidebar
3. View real-time or historical logs

## API Endpoints

Your backend exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/search?query=<product_name>` - Search for products
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

## Support

If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Check the Render documentation: https://render.com/docs
2. Review your application logs
3. Verify your repository structure matches expectations
