# Smart Shopping Hub - Frontend Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing package.json**: The client directory was missing the package.json file which is essential for npm operations
2. **Incorrect index.html paths**: The index.html file had incorrect absolute paths that were causing build errors
3. **Missing vite.config.js**: The Vite configuration file was missing, which is needed for proper build configuration
4. **GitHub Pages deployment**: Redeployed the frontend to GitHub Pages with correct configuration

## Files Created/Fixed

1. `client/package.json` - Added missing package.json with proper dependencies and scripts
2. `client/vite.config.js` - Added Vite configuration with correct base path
3. `client/index.html` - Fixed incorrect paths to use relative paths instead of absolute paths

## Deployment Status

✅ **Frontend**: Successfully rebuilt and redeployed to GitHub Pages
✅ **Backend**: Already properly configured (from previous work)
✅ **Redirect URLs**: All fixed and working properly (from previous work)

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for GitHub Pages Update**: It may take a few minutes for GitHub Pages to fully update
2. **Check Site**: Visit https://mohansaina.github.io/smart-shopping-hub/ to verify the site is working
3. **Verify Backend Connection**: Make sure the frontend can connect to your Render backend (if deployed)

## Troubleshooting

If the site still shows a 404 error:

1. **Check GitHub Repository Settings**:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Ensure "Source" is set to "gh-pages" branch
   - Ensure the folder is set to "/ (root)"

2. **Redeploy if needed**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Check GitHub Actions** (if enabled):
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Check if there are any failed deployment workflows

## Testing

After the site is accessible:
1. Try searching for products
2. Verify that results are displayed
3. Check that "Buy Now" buttons redirect to Amazon/Flipkart correctly
4. Test on different devices to ensure responsiveness

The frontend should now be properly deployed and accessible at https://mohansaina.github.io/smart-shopping-hub/
